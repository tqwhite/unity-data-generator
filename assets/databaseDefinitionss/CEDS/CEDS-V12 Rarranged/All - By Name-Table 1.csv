The metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into three metro and six nonmetro groupings, resulting in a nine-part county codification. The codes allow researchers working with county data to break such data into finer residential groups beyond a simple metro-nonmetro dichotomy, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that may be related to degree of rurality and metro proximity.","Adult Education -> AE Student -> Academic Record -> Academic Award

000148,Homeless Unaccompanied Youth Status,"A homeless unaccompanied youth is a youth who is not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian and who fits the McKinney-Vento definition of homeless.  Students must be both unaccompanied and homeless to be included as unaccompanied homeless youth. There is no age range specified for an unaccompanied youth in the law. The upper age range is determined by what a state defines as school age, unless the child is in special education. The upper age range for students in special education may extend to 22 years of age. There is no lower age range. Therefore, as an example, a young child not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian, though living with a caregiver, and is living in a situation that is not fixed, regular, and adequate, would be identified as a homeless unaccompanied youth.","Adult Education -> AE Student -> Academic Record -> Academic Award

For example, for a homeless student the Status Begin Date and Status End Date elements are used to record when the student began being homeless to the date when the student ceased being homeless.  The student may begin receiving services under a program for homeless students after becoming homeless and that program may continue to provide services after the student ceases to have the status of ""homeless"" and therefore have a Program Participation Start Date and Program Participation Exit Date that are different from the status dates.
