Use Program Participation Exit Date if referring to a person's participation in a program or receipt of services. Status dates and program participation dates don't need to align, they are for different purposes. For example, for a homeless student the Status Begin Date and Status End Date elements are used to record when the student began being homeless to the date when the student ceased being homeless.  The student may begin receiving services under a program for homeless students after becoming homeless and that program may continue to provide services after the student ceases to have the status of ""homeless"" and therefore have a Program Participation Start Date and Program Participation Exit Date that are different from the status dates.  Students under the McKinney-Vento may continue to receive services until the end of a school year even if they become stably housed at some point during the year.",001228,,StatusEndDate,,https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetails.aspx?termid=24193
