The candidate must associate the gap choices with the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices. Care should be taken when designing these interactions to ensure that the gaps in the image are a suitable size to receive the required gap choices. It must be clear to the candidate which hotspot each choice has been associated with. When associated, choices must appear wholly inside the gaps if at all possible and, where overlaps are required, should not hide each other completely. If the candidate indicates the association by positioning the choice over the gap (e.g., drag and drop) the system should 'snap' it to the nearest position that satisfies these requirements. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.",,,,
001108,Assessment Item Body Graphic Order Interaction XML,"A graphic order interaction is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to impose an ordering on the areas (hotspots).

The interaction is initialized from the defaultValue of the associated response variable, a NULL value indicating that no choices are selected (the usual case). The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.",,,,
001114,Assessment Item Body Inline Choice Interaction XML,"A inline choice is an inline interaction that presents the user with a set of choices, each of which is a simple piece of text.

001105,Assessment Item Body Match Interaction XML,"A match interaction presents candidates with two sets of choices and allows them to create associates between pairs of choices in the two sets, but not between pairs of choices in the same set. Further restrictions can still be placed on the allowable associations using the matchMax attribute of the choices. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.",,,,
001115,Assessment Item Body Media Interaction XML,"The media interaction allows more control over the way the candidate interacts with a time-based media object and allows the number of times the media object was experienced to be reported in the value of the associated response variable, which must be of base-type integer and single cardinality.

Only the actual position(s) selected by the candidate shall be indicated. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.",,,,
001110,Assessment Item Body Select Point Interaction,"A graphic associate interaction is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image.
