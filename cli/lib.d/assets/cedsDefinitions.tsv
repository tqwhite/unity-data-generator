001102    The custom interaction provides an opportunity for extensibility of this specification to include support for interactions not currently documented.  The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001103    The drawing interaction allows the candidate to use a common set of drawing tools to modify a given graphical image (the canvas). It must be bound to a response variable with base-type file and single cardinality. The result is a file in the same format as the original image. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001104    A gap match interaction contains a number gaps that the candidate can fill from an associated set of choices. The candidate must be able to review the content with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001105    A match interaction presents candidates with two sets of choices and allows them to create associates between pairs of choices in the two sets, but not between pairs of choices in the same set. Further restrictions can still be placed on the allowable associations using the matchMax attribute of the choices. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001106    A graphic gap-match interaction is a graphical interaction with a set of gaps that are defined as areas (hotspots) of the graphic image and an additional set of gap choices that are defined outside the image. The candidate must associate the gap choices with the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices. Care should be taken when designing these interactions to ensure that the gaps in the image are a suitable size to recei...
001107    A hotspot interaction is a graphical interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to select one or more of the areas (hotspots). The hotspot interaction should only be used when the spatial relationship of the choices with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item. Otherwise, choiceInteraction should be used instead with separate material for each option. The XML ...
001108    A graphic order interaction is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to impose an ordering on the areas (hotspots). The order hotspot interaction should only be used when the spatial relationship of the choices with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item. Otherwise, orderInteraction should be used instead with separate material for each option....
001109    Like hotspotInteraction, a select point interaction is a graphic interaction. The candidate's task is to select one or more points. The associated response may have an areaMapping that scores the response on the basis of comparing it against predefined areas but the delivery engine must not indicate these areas of the image. Only the actual point(s) selected by the candidate shall be indicated. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001110    A graphic associate interaction is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to associate the areas (hotspots) with each other. The graphic associate interaction should only be used when the graphical relationship of the choices with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item. Otherwise, associateInteraction should be used instead with separate Materia...
001111    The slider interaction presents the candidate with a control for selecting a numerical value between a lower and upper bound. It must be bound to a response variable with single cardinality with a base-type of either integer or float. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001112    The choice interaction presents a set of choices to the candidate. The candidate's task is to select one or more of the choices, up to a maximum of maxChoices. The interaction is always initialized with no choices selected. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001114    A inline choice is an inline interaction that presents the user with a set of choices, each of which is a simple piece of text. The candidate's task is to select one of the choices. Unlike the Choice Interaction, the delivery engine must allow the candidate to review their choice within the context of the surrounding text.
001115    The media interaction allows more control over the way the candidate interacts with a time-based media object and allows the number of times the media object was experienced to be reported in the value of the associated response variable, which must be of base-type integer and single cardinality. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.

Like choiceInteraction, the candidate's task is to select one or more of the choices, up to a maximum of maxChoices. The interaction is initialized from the defaultValue of the associated response variable, a NULL value indicating that no choices are selected (the usual case). The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specifi...
001117    In an order interaction the candidate's task is to reorder the choices, the order in which the choices are displayed initially is significant. By default the candidate's task is to order all of the choices but a subset of the choices can be requested using the maxChoices and minChoices attributes. When specified the candidate must select a subset of the choices and impose an ordering on them. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001118    The position object interaction consists of a single image which must be positioned on another graphic image (the stage) by the candidate. Like selectPointInteraction, the associated response may have an areaMapping that scores the response on the basis of comparing it against predefined areas but the delivery engine must not indicate these areas of the stage. Only the actual position(s) selected by the candidate shall be indicated. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be incl...
001119    A textEntry interaction obtains a simple piece of text from the candidate. Like inlineChoiceInteraction, the delivery engine must allow the candidate to review their choice within the context of the surrounding text. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001120    An extended text interaction allows the candidate to enter an extended amount of text. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001121    The end attempt interaction is a special type of interaction which allows item authors to provide the candidate with control over the way in which the candidate terminates an attempt.

001130    Describes an issue related to the security of a testing instrument identified during a specific instance of delivering an assessment to a specific person during a specific time period.
001131    These templates are described using the processing language defined in IMS Global APIP specification and are distributed (in XML form) along with it. Delivery engines that support generalized response processing do not need to implement special mechanisms to support them as a template file can be parsed directly while processing the assessment item that refers to it. This element provides the URL for the template.
001132    Response processing is the process by which the Delivery Engine assigns outcomes based on the learner's responses. The outcomes may be used to provide feedback to the learner Feedback is either provided immediately following the end of the learner's attempt or it is provided at some later time, perhaps as part of a summary report on the item session. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001133    Response declarations state what the response variables include.  The response declaration may assign an optional correct response. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001134    Outcome variables are declared by outcome declarations. Their value is set either from a default given in the declaration itself or by a responseRule during response processing.  The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001135    Template declarations declare item variables that are to be used specifically for the purposes of cloning items. They can have their value set only during template processing. They are referred to within the item body in order to individualize the clone and possibly also within the response Processing rules if the cloning process affects the way the item is scored.  The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001136    Template processing consists of one or more template rules that are followed by the cloning engine or delivery system in order to assign values to the template variables. Template processing is identical in form to responseProcessing except that the purpose is to assign values to template variables, not outcome variables. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001137    Modal feedback is shown to the candidate directly following response processing. The value of an outcome variable is used in conjunction with the showHide and identifier attributes to determine whether or not the feedback is shown in a similar way to feedbackElement. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.
001138    The item body contains the text, graphics, media objects, and interactions that describe the item's content and information about how it is structured. The body is presented by combining it with stylesheet information, either explicitly or implicitly using the default style rules of the delivery or authoring system.
